all frontend curret and new pages should use Tailwind with shadcn/ui instead of mui and be styled a lot better, 
and make sure it integrated with backend , also there should be blog pages and control to add blogs 
from admin control pannel also pages for checking if user has gaps in his skilles than the job 
needs and give him advices for that ,also what is his personality and jobs that suitable is stored in db to give him 
advice as personality and traits for it and carrer path recomendation and there are tables for all of that 
and check if pages available otherwise add them , also feature for points for user if 
he did interactions and posting commects ... etc 
he will get points and amount of these points can be converted to subscription kind of available kinds , 
also here there are notes in this file below , 
putted in like question answer you can use them to execute things, 
also there are json files in same folder of this file you can check for quick reference if you want for apis of 
backend and ai apis for python service just need to pull reapo to see that folder

From the Postman file — about automatically maping API endpoints (like /users, /jobs, /applications, /videos, /analytics, etc.) to the dashboard widgets and pages data and result? Or defineinig a new, cleaner dashboard routes (e.g. /dashboard/summary, /dashboard/notifications) and implementing them in the backend ?
yes map them to existing one ,  only if there is no endpoint offer a thing or an endpoint can not be changed or updated to offer that ,you can add one but make sure alot if current ones can be used or updated
and for upload viedos singin singup by different ways and the context for booth videos and auth and chat do not do new ones for them for sure , also Videos.jsx page is working very will for current things it has , prevoise pages are working and tested with the frontend pages also use pages in forent end taht are used for that they are working very well with backend but you required and better change style width and the looking to be better and to use taillwind and shadcn/ui in styling them instead of mui and as what we want to say here about styling
Should analytics and insights be pre-computed on the backend (like totals, charts, response rates) or fetched raw and calculated on the frontend (e.g. count applications client-side)?
Check how current routes and current backend work and decide the best thing to be used
For notifications and requests — do you want real-time updates (e.g., via websockets or Firebase listeners), or just refresh/poll every 60 seconds?
yes realtime
Are the “AI Insights” (like “You’re 2x more likely to get hired…”) already part of the backend, or should the prompt include logic for calling a GPT-powered endpoint like /ai/insights that uses user data?
the ai endpoints are attached as json file here also a file for nodjs backedn api is attached if that better for quick reference , also the ai is done by paython backend service not by nodejs ,
if any endpoints missing or needed other current ones you can make them in the python service files in the AI_ServiceServiceApi folder
🎨 UI/UX Design Fine-Tuning
For motion and animation, do you prefer:
Framer Motion for micro animations (card entry, hover glow, transitions), or
A lightweight CSS-based approach for performance (e.g., Tailwind motion classes)?
use Tailwind motion classess forperformance and regarding pages make them all use tailwind and shadcn/ui for all pages instead of mui in pages that use them currentlly.
Should the dashboards have a unified top navbar (showing user avatar, notifications, settings) across both roles, or keep navigation strictly in the sidebar?
no without top navbar
but if showing which page user in , the breadcrumb navigation.
Do you want a mode switch between Job Seeker and Employer views (e.g., toggle in the sidebar if an account has both roles)?
No as the user have one role only , except admin if he want to toggle from admin dashboard to either jobseeker or employer like for viewing or testing.
and so also there are admin dashboard that contian all thing realted for users or moderation and suprvision checking overall things or deleting some not good content .. etc
For illustrations in empty states, do you want:
Custom minimal line-style illustrations , or
Prebuilt animated Lottie icons that fit the SwipeScout aesthetic?
Decide which better 
📊 Analytics & Charts
Do you want both roles to use the same chart types (line for engagement, pie for skill level, etc.), or different ones (e.g., Job Seekers get personal analytics, Employers get hiring funnel charts)?
Different ones i think better
Should analytics include comparison metrics (e.g., “+23% profile views vs last week”)?
Yes Ok.
🧩 Reusable Components & Integration
Should I define a shared design system folder (like /components/UI/) for elements such as Card, MetricBox, ChartWidget, Toast, VideoPreview, etc.?
Yes
Do you want the Dashboard layout to live under a shared layout file (e.g., /app/dashboard/layout.tsx) so both dashboards reuse the same structure, or do you want two completely separate layouts (/dashboard/jobseeker/ and /dashboard/employer/)?
To be two completely separate
For the video previews, do you want them embedded directly on the dashboard or just linked to the “My Videos” or “Find Talent” pages?
Choose if booth or better way.
🧠 Final Functional Touches
Should users be able to drag-and-drop widgets (customize their dashboard), or is layout fixed?
Yes Ok  be able to
Should analytics data persist across sessions (cached per user), or refresh fresh from backend every time they open it?
choose to be Refresh from backend or better ways, also  real data for the possible or realvent things
Should employers see team-level stats (e.g., multiple recruiters under one company), or only individual account metrics for now?
choose the best
A) Data and plumbing
Realtime transport - use our own backend websockets or Firebase listeners as the source of truth for notifications, matches, chat counts, etc.
Check current things and choose best expand or add
SSR vs CSR - should the first dashboard paint use SSR with cookies or client fetch only.
Choose the best 
Metrics per role - confirm the exact list that shows at the top of each dashboard:
each user has one role except the admin
Job seeker: Profile views, Matches, Applications, Unread messages, Saves, Response rate, Video views, Watch time ...etc
Employer: Applicants, Shortlisted, Interviews scheduled, Unread messages, Job views, Apply rate, Save rate .. etc
Edit as needed.
Admin add all pages needed that are not exists and make a dashboard for it as will
B) Widgets and layout
Video preview on dashboard - embed a small autoplay-muted hero video on the dashboard or only link to My Videos or Find Talent.
After pressing “Connect,” user sees Company Details or Candidate Details popup (like your sketch).
“Open Profile” goes to profile id page with all videos and apply/message buttons.
When users mutually connect (like each other), should it trigger a match modal that says “It’s a match!” and automatically create a chat thread in Messages?
🔍 Detailed Search Tab
check page for search and there should be if not
Search keyword
Location
Salary min/max
Job Type (Full-time / Part-time / Contract / Freelance)
Experience Level
(For employers: candidate filters like skills, experience, education, language, availability)
Anything else to add?
decide if thing applicable also
When searching, should results display as cards with company logo, job title, salary, and location? 
yes ok
Metrics per role - confirm the exact list that shows at the top of each dashboard:
decide the best
B) Widgets and layout
Top navbar - do we include a slim top bar with avatar and notifications, or keep navigation strictly in the sidebar. You mentioned one role per account, but this is about placement of controls.
C) Visual details
Chart theming - Recharts with SwipeScout colors and soft glow, yes.also  Any preference for default time range on charts: last 7 days, last 30 days, or remember last selection.
D) Admin
Admin viewer toggle - allow Admin to switch view into Job Seeker or Employer dashboards in read-only mode. If yes, show a clear “Viewing as” chip and a return to Admin button. Confirm.
🧠 Connect Flow
Pagination: show 6–8 results per page or infinite scroll like Explore?
ok
🗂 Job Listings Tab
The Job Listings tab acts as a saved list + all available jobs.
no i can choose if saved or available
Should users be able to sort by relevance, newest, salary, or company name?
yes
Should “Save” jobs persist to backend ?
yes
When clicking “View Details,” should it reuse the Open Profile layout (company info + videos), right?
choose what is better and best
🧩 Employer “Find Talent”
For Employers:
Explore → swipe through candidate videos
Detailed Search → advanced filters (skills, experience, education, etc.)
Candidates → saved / shortlisted profiles
Correct?
yes ok and you can decide
When an employer clicks “Invite” on a candidate, should it create a job invitation object visible to the candidate under Notifications?
Yes
🧠 AI Integration
The Python AI service offers endpoints like /api/analyze-text and /api/analyze-interview.
Should these be used to:
Auto-generate skill tags from videos/descriptions?
it from video speach/ transcription also from relevant data and make that stored in the db to make help make match and etc
Create short summaries under cards like “This company values creativity and collaboration”?
ok
Recommend matches (AI rank ordering of feed)?
yes according user profile and preferences and so on 
and for that to specified clearly even for the user in his dashboard and he can edit and change that
⚙️ Integration + Performance
Use the existing backend endpoints from Node/Express for all CRUD operations (search, list, match, connect). Only propose new ones if missing. Correct?
yes
Should the feed and listings cache recently viewed videos/jobs to minimize reloads between tabs?
ok if relevant
Should all feeds update live (WebSocket), or only update after refresh / re-enter?
live and in best possible way can be added to current backend
✨ UI / Motion / Style
Maintain SwipeScout’s purple-cyan glow aesthetic, glassmorphism cards, and rounded corners everywhere, correct?
choose the best
Do you want motion transitions when switching between tabs (e.g., slide/fade like shadcn/ui tabs + Tailwind motion)?
ok
Empty states — use same animated Lottie style as dashboards or custom static illustrations?
choose the best



 for points system which thing not fully implemented in frontend yes that allow some points earned from interactions by user then some amount of them can converted to a subscription kind

 
 on notifications :

 Notes and suggestions

For higher quality assurance, adding a simple integration test (using supertest in the backend suite) for:
POST /notifications/register should save and return device payload.
DELETE /notifications/register should clear and return device payload with nulls.
PUT /notifications/settings should set desktop_notifications inside user.notificationSettings.
Optionally consider:
Returning the updated notificationSettings in the register/deregister responses if you want the UI to use this to update available settings without additional API calls.
Implementing multi-device support (array of subscriptions) if that's needed for multi-device persistence.
Consolidating notification settings schema (UserSettings vs. user.notificationSettings), because both the UserSettings entity and user.notificationSettings JSONB are currently in play — this can lead to some duplication or mismatch if both are used for overlapping properties. Consider centralizing values in one canonical place to avoid future confusion.
Build notes:
Frontend: cd d:\_projts\frontend && yarn build (build succeeded in this session).
Backend: cd d:\_projts\backend && npm run build (the backend also built successfully earlier in the session; one build attempt showed errors unrelated to our changes — those are existing issues in other files).
Next steps (optional)

Add automated tests for the register/deregister endpoints.
Update the UI to show live “device registered” status, not only toasts, e.g., show the endpoint or a toggle status that indicates the server state.
Consider small consolidation or migration to standardize where notification preferences are stored (UserSettings vs user.notificationSettings).
Add more robust error handling & user messages for push permission errors or invalid subscriptions.
If you'd like, I can:

Add a supertest-based backend test for the register/deregister flow and the update notification settings flow.
Update the UI to display the registered device info in Settings (instead of just a toast).
Add an optional server-side log entry/analytics event for device registration/deregistration.
Which of these would you like next?
